I am currently a PhD candidate in Economics at [IRES](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/lidam/ires) (UCLouvain) and teaching assistant at [FOPES](https://uclouvain.be/fr/facultes/espo/fopes) (UCLouvain). My research focuses on the economics of inequality: I am currently working on the evolution of income inequality in Belgium, within the [Distributional National Accounts](https://wid.world/fr/news-article/2020-distributional-national-accounts-guidelines-dina-2/) framework. I also teach two courses at the [Haute Ã‰cole ISFSC](https://www.isfsc.be/) in Brussels.
