We do this using a regression discontinuity approach that allows us to causally attribute mainstream parties' positional changes to radical right strength independent of public opinion as a potential confounder. Making use of exogenous variation created through differences in electoral thresholds, we empirically demonstrate that radical right success, indeed, causally affects mainstream parties' positions. This is true for mainstream left as well as mainstream right parties. These findings make an important contribution to the broader literature on party competition as they indicate that other parties' behavior and not only public opinion plays a crucial role in explaining parties' policy shift.},

  abstract = {We present a framework for understanding the effects of automation and other types of technological changes on labor demand, and use it to interpret changes in US employment over the recent past. At the center of our framework is the allocation of tasks to capital and labor---the task content of production. Automation, which enables capital to replace labor in tasks it was previously engaged in, shifts the task content of production against labor because of a displacement effect. As a result, automation always reduces the labor share in value added and may reduce labor demand even as it raises productivity. The effects of automation are counterbalanced by the creation of new tasks in which labor has a comparative advantage. The introduction of new tasks changes the task content of production in favor of labor because of a reinstatement effect, and always raises the labor share and labor demand. We show how the role of changes in the task content of production---due to automation and new tasks---can be inferred from industry-level data. Our empirical decomposition suggests that the slower growth of employment over the last three decades is accounted for by an acceleration in the displacement effect, especially in manufacturing, a weaker reinstatement effect, and slower growth of productivity than in previous decades.}

However, estimating the causal impact of these policies is challenging. I describe how the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) can be used in undergraduate econometrics or capstone courses to estimate the impact of economic policies. The SCM is a data-driven design that provides a systematic way of constructing a comparison group that looks very similar to the group implementing the policy. Thus, it allows us to estimate the policy's impact by comparing the outcome variable's post-policy path between the policy group and the comparison group. I review a broad range of policies and events that are analyzed using this method, briefly describe the theory behind the method, discuss various best practices, and provide a step-by-step implementation guide using the adoption of a value-added tax (VAT) by France as an example.

  abstract = {Abstract             This article examines the impact of establishing a large industrial manufacturing entity on employment and the labor market in a remote, sparsely populated part of Sweden, focusing on how it affects total regional employment because industrial policies aiming to attract investment and reignite employment in stagnating regions have been a central policy tool. The empirical analysis is based on the synthetic control method, which enables the estimation of place-specific causal effects. Using aggregated microdata from 1995 to 2019, the results indicate that employment in the treated region, as compared to synthetic regions, has been negatively affected by the manufacturing establishment. However, the short- and long-term effects differ across different labor market segments (same, related, and unrelated industries) and according to firm size. Overall, the findings suggest that large manufacturing investment does not necessarily have a positive or instantaneous impact on total regional employment. It does, however, provide some potential for long-term diversification because employment in related activities grows in the long run.           ,              Este art{\'i}culo examina el impacto del establecimiento de una gran entidad industrial manufacturera en el empleo y el mercado laboral de una zona remota y escasamente poblada de Suecia, para lo cu{\'a}l se centra en c{\'o}mo afecta al empleo regional total, ya que las pol{\'i}ticas industriales destinadas a atraer inversiones y reactivar el empleo en regiones estancadas han sido una herramienta pol{\'i}tica esencial. El an{\'a}lisis emp{\'i}rico se basa en el m{\'e}todo de control sint{\'e}tico, que permite estimar los efectos causales espec{\'i}ficos de cada lugar. Se utilizaron microdatos agregados de 1995 a 2019, y los resultados indican que el empleo en la regi{\'o}n de estudio, en comparaci{\'o}n con las regiones sint{\'e}ticas, se ha visto afectado negativamente por la entidad manufacturera. Sin embargo, los efectos a corto y largo plazo difieren entre los distintos segmentos del mercado laboral (mismo sector, sectores relacionados y no relacionados) y seg{\'u}n el tama{\~n}o de la empresa. En general, los resultados sugieren que las grandes inversiones manufactureras no tienen necesariamente un impacto positivo o instant{\'a}neo en el empleo regional total. Sin embargo, ofrece cierto potencial para la diversificaci{\'o}n a largo plazo porque el empleo en actividades relacionadas crece a la larga.           ,              景気の低迷が続く地域に投資を呼び込み、雇用の再活性化を目的とした産業政策が政策手段の中心となってきたことから、本稿ではスウェーデンの辺境の人口の少ない地域における大規模な工業生産施設の設立が雇用と労働市場に与える影響を、地域全体の雇用にどのような影響を与えるかに焦点を当てて検証する。実証分析は合成コントロール法に基づいており、場所固有の因果効果の推定が可能である。1995{\textasciitilde}2019年までの集計されたマイクロデータを使用したところ、結果から、合成した他の地域と比較して、当該地域の雇用が生産施設の設立によって悪影響を受けることが示される。しかし、短期的・長期的な影響は、労働市場の部門(同業種、関連業種、非関連業種)や企業の規模によって異なる。概して、この結果から、生産施設への大型投資は、地域全体の雇用に必ずしもプラスまたは即効性のある影響を与えないことが示唆される。しかし、長期的には関連活動での雇用が増加するため、長期的な多角化の可能性はある程度与えられる。},

  abstract = {In this paper, we assess the impact of fiscal consolidation on income inequality. Using a panel of 18 industrialized countries from 1978 to 2009, we find that income inequality significantly rises during periods of fiscal consolidation. In addition, while fiscal policy that is driven by spending cuts seems to be detrimental for income distribution, tax hikes seem to have an equalizing effect. We also show that the size of the fiscal consolidation program (in percentage of               GDP               ) has an impact on income inequality. In particular, when consolidation plans represent a small share of               GDP               , the income gap widens, suggesting that the burden associated with the effort affects disproportionately households at the bottom of the income distribution. Considering the linkages between banking crises and fiscal consolidation, we find that the effect on the income gap is amplified when fiscal adjustments take place after the resolution of such financial turmoil. Similarly, fiscal consolidation programs combined with inflation are likely to increase inequality and the effects of fiscal adjustments on inequality are amplified during periods of relatively low growth. Our results also provide support for a non-linear relationship between inequality and income and corroborate the idea that trade can promote a more equal distribution of income.},

Furthermore, the Expert Group also focused on developing distributional results for household macro balance sheets, starting with national data from the euro area Member States. The Expert Group assessed the extent to which these two sets of statistics could be compared and was able to link most balance sheet items. Since, following adjustments, the estimates yielded from the micro data were still lower than the macro data, an estimation method was developed to gross up the micro data to be in line with the macro data results. The methodology delivers estimates of the distribution of household wealth that are closely aligned with Financial Accounts aggregates, thereby offering valuable new information for the purposes of macroeconomic analyses based on such Financial Accounts. Further research is needed to examine the robustness of these results and to improve the estimation method taking into account country-specific features and information. The Expert Group has therefore recommended further work be undertaken with a view to compiling experimental distributional results by end-2022. JEL Classification: D31, G51},

However, SCM suffers from weaknesses that compromise its accuracy, stability and meaningfulness, due to the nested optimization problem of covariate relevance and counterfactual weights. We propose a decoupling of both problems. We evaluate the economic effect of government formation deadlock in Spain-2016 and find that SCM method overestimates the effect by 0.23 pp. Furthermore, we replicate two studies and compare results from standard and decoupled SCM. Decoupled SCM offers higher accuracy and stability, while ensuring the economic meaningfulness of covariates used in building the counterfactual.},

The other chronicles the timing and results of national elections. We find that liberalizing reforms are associated with economic benefits that accrue only gradually over time. Because of this delay, liberalizing reforms are costly to democratic incumbents when they are implemented close to elections. Electoral outcomes also depend on the state of the economy: Reforms are penalized during contractions but are often rewarded in expansions.},

  abstract = {When evaluating the impact of a policy (e.g., gun control) on a metric of interest (e.g., crime-rate), it may not be possible or feasible to conduct a randomized control trial. In such settings where only observational data is available, synthetic control (SC) methods [2-4] provide a popular data-driven approach to estimate a "synthetic" or "virtual" control by combining measurements of "similar" alternatives or units (called "donors"). Recently, robust synthetic control (RSC) [7] was proposed as a generalization of SC to overcome the challenges of missing data and high levels of noise, while removing the reliance on expert domain knowledge for selecting donors. However, both SC and RSC (and its variants) suffer from poor estimation when the pre-intervention period is too short. As the main contribution of this work, we propose a generalization of unidimensional RSC to multi-dimensional Robust Synthetic Control, mRSC. Our proposed mechanism, mRSC, incorporates multiple types of measurements (or metrics) in addition to the measurement of interest for estimating a synthetic control, thus overcoming the challenge of poor inference due to limited amounts of pre-intervention data. We show that the mRSC algorithm, when using K relevant metrics, leads to a consistent estimator of the synthetic control for the target unit of interest under any metric. Our finite-sample analysis suggests that the mean-squared error (MSE) of our predictions decays to zero at a rate faster than the RSC algorithm by a factor of K and {\textsurd}K for the training (pre-intervention) and testing (post-intervention) periods, respectively. Additionally, we propose a principled scheme to combine multiple metrics of interest via a diagnostic test that evaluates if adding a metric can be expected to result in improved inference. Our mechanism for validating mRSC performance is also an important and related contribution of this work: time series prediction. We propose a method to predict the future evolution of a time series based on limited data when the notion of time is relative and not absolute, i.e., where we have access to a donor pool that has already undergone the desired future evolution. We conduct extensive experimentation to establish the efficacy of mRSC in three different scenarios: predicting the evolution of a metric of interest using synthetically generated data from a known factor model, and forecasting weekly sales and score trajectories of a Walmart store and Cricket game, respectively.},

  abstract = {Policymakers and economists are becoming increasingly concerned about wealth inequality. Here we estimate Belgium's wealth distribution --- and based on this distribution --- the revenue potential, distributional impact, and environmental effect of three proposals for a one-off Belgian wealth tax. Our method consists of (1) estimating the Belgian wealth distribution by extending survey data with a top-tail Pareto distribution based on a novel national rich list, and (2) combining the estimated wealth distribution with proposed tax configurations and published elasticities. There are four main results. First, the wealthiest 1\% of households possess {\textasciitilde}24\% of total net wealth, substantially more than previous estimates suggest. Second, the revenue potential of a one-off tax is considerably higher than estimated by wealth tax advocates. Third, the distributional impact would be limited as the richest 1\% of households would still possess at least 23\% of total net wealth. Fourth, a one-off tax would likely reduce CO2 emissions by only 0.1--0.6\%. Overall, our findings suggest a one-off wealth tax could finance over half of Belgium's COVID-19 costs, but would lead to only small reductions in wealth inequality and environmental impact. Ecological economists may therefore wish to pursue other policy proposals to achieve fair distribution and sustainable scale.},

We confirm previous findings where the redistributive effect of cash transfers is larger than that of in-kind transfers, indirect taxes, and collective consumption, but their difference depends substantially on common methodological choices. First, we apply administrative data to identify actual use of in-kind transfers and compare their redistributive effects to those from simpler allocation rules advocated in the distributional national account literature when actual transfers are not observed. Second, we show that the use of the insurance value (age and gender specific mean use) as an alternative allocation brings the redistributive effect of in-kind transfers far closer to that of cash transfers. Third, we adjust for life cycle differences and show that while in-kind transfers mainly redistribute income across age groups, redistribution from cash transfers takes place both within and across age groups.},

That is why many academics have seen the potential of this data source for the prediction of electoral elections. Therefore, it is necessary to review what kind of machine learning models perform better in predicting election results. Therefore, a literature review is carried out, following the guidelines of the PRISMA methodology, for which databases such as Scopus, IEEE-Xplore, Science Direct, Google Academic, Springer, Ebscohost, Iop, Wiley, and Sage were used. After the literature review analysis, a total of 1638 manuscripts related to the research topic were obtained, and the inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. Thus, 69 manuscripts were systematized. The results showed that one of the models most used by the scientific community is sentiment analysis. It was also noted that the best performing model was random forest (RF), with an accuracy rate of 97\%. In the second place, we have the recurrent neural networks (RNNs) model with an accuracy rate of 91.6\%. However, unlike RF, RNN requires a high computational knowledge and effort. Finally, it is concluded that the RF model is the most suitable for the prediction of electoral results since it can perform better in this type of case.},

Particularly, analysis of granular price quote data from the UK indicates that increased digitalization may have raised price flexibility, while de-globalization may have made inflation more responsive to domestic economic conditions again. Using sectoral data from 24 advanced economies in Europe, higher digitalization and lower trade intensity are shown to be associated with steeper Phillips curves. Post-pandemic Phillips curve estimates indicate some steepening in the UK, Spain, Italy and the euro area as a whole, but at magnitudes that are too small to explain the entire surge in inflation in 2021-22, suggesting an important role for outward shifts in the Phillips curve},

We include information from academic studies and publicly available databases that contain statistics on the evolution of market (or factor) income, gross or pre-tax income, taxable income or disposable income. This evidence relies on data from surveys, administrative tax register data or national accounts. Most sources document that income inequality in Belgium is rather stable over the period considered. Yet, an overall definitive conclusion about the evolution of inequality for different income concepts is hard to distil from the different sources, given missing information, inconsistent definitions over time and structural breaks between the underlying datasets.}

Based on an econometric analysis of the determinants of wage moderation in sixteen industrialized countries between 1974 and 2000, it argues that the organizational characteristics of trade unions have a significant impact on wage dynamics. Controlling for a number of institutional and economic factors, the countries in which trade union confederations directly involve workers in the process of collective bargaining ratification have on average lower wage growth relative to productivity than others. The authors also find that collective bargaining coordination and contract ratification magnify each other's wage-dampening effect. Through case studies of Ireland and Italy, the article examines the causal mechanisms underlying the uncovered statistical regularities and concludes that, particularly at a time in which classic political exchange is waning, worker involvement in contract ratification allows confederation leaders to resolve conflicting claims inside their organizations at lower wage levels than are achieved by a less participatory governance process.},

  abstract = {The particularly rapid acceleration in inflation in Belgium and the fact that it is currently outpacing inflation in the euro area has, in some circles, raised questions as to the role of the indexation mechanism. A first question which might arise concerns the extent to which that mechanism lies behind the current acceleration in inflation. A second question is whether that mechanism will maintain the current inflationary process by triggering a price-wage spiral. The article -- which is based on the available HICP data up to April 2008 -- examines these two questions, first analysing the factors at the root of the current acceleration in inflation and the positive gap between Belgium and the euro area, and then discussing the potential repercussions of the current inflationary process on wage setting. Regarding the first question, the analysis presented in the article provides a clear answer : neither the acceleration in inflation nor the positive gap in relation to the euro area can so far be attributed to the Belgian indexation mechanism. The acceleration in inflation is in fact due entirely to the strong pressure from prices of energy and processed food, whereas there has so far been no sign of any rise in inflation for three-quarters of the products making up the consumption basket, particularly non- energy goods and services. What is more, it is precisely for this last category of goods that labour costs are most important as a determinant of inflation. On the second question, it appears that, in the current circumstances, and despite an undeniable moderating influence, the use of the health index did not prevent an acceleration in wage increases resulting from indexation in the first quarter of 2008. However, the law of 1996 on the promotion of employment and the safeguarding of competitiveness places Belgium's indexation practice in a broader framework governing the movement in private sector wages. More particularly, the cycle of pay negotiations relating to 2009 and 2010, scheduled for the autumn, offers the social partners the opportunity to take account of the indexation when determining the pay increases, and thus to continue the tendency of recent years, which consisted in reconciling indexation with responsible pay settlements. In these conditions it will be possible to prevent a price-wage spiral, to contribute to the preservation of competitiveness and employment and to ensure that Belgian inflation does not remain permanently above the level in the euro area.}

Increased deductions in taxable income for union members led to higher membership rates and contributed to a lower decline in union membership rates over time in Norway. Accounting for selection effects and the potential endogeneity of unionisation, the results show that increasing union density at the firm level leads to a substantial increase in both productivity and wages. The wage effect is larger in more productive firms, consistent with rent-sharing models.},

  abstract = {Gun violence is a critical public health and safety concern in the United States. There is considerable variability in policy proposals meant to curb gun violence, ranging from increasing gun availability to deter potential assailants (e.g., concealed carry laws or arming school teachers) to restricting access to firearms (e.g., universal background checks or banning assault weapons). Many studies use state-level variation in the enactment of these policies in order to quantify their effect on gun violence. In this paper, we discuss the policy trial emulation framework for evaluating the impact of these policies, and show how to apply this framework to estimating impacts via difference-in-differences and synthetic controls when there is staggered adoption of policies across jurisdictions, estimating the impacts of right-to-carry laws on violent crime as a case study.},

Using a newly constructed historical cross-country database on capital shares and top income data, we find evidence on a strong, positive link that has grown stronger over the past century. The connection is stronger in Anglo-Saxon countries, in the very top of the distribution, when top capital incomes predominate, when using distributed top national income shares, and when considering gross of depreciation capital shares. Out of-sample predictions of top shares using capital shares indicates several cases of over- or underestimation.}

We use them to characterize entire distributions, including places like the top where power laws are a good description, and places further down where they are not. We develop a method to nonparametrically recover the entire distribution based on tabulated income or wealth data as is generally available from tax authorities, which produces smooth and realistic shapes of generalized Pareto curves. Using detailed tabulations from quasi-exhaustive tax data, we demonstrate the precision of our method both empirically and analytically. It gives better results than the most commonly used interpolation techniques. Finally, we use Pareto curves to identify recurring distributional patterns, and connect those findings to the existing literature that explains observed distributions by random growth models.},

We document a notable and statistically significant reduction in the proportion of the Hispanic noncitizen population in Arizona. The decline observed matches the timing of LAWA's implementation, deviates from the time series for the synthetic control group, and stands out relative to the distribution of placebo estimates for other states in the nation.},

We study how this universalism-particularism divide is crystallizing into a full-blown cleavage, complete with structural, political and identity elements. So far, little research exists on the identities that voters themselves perceive as relevant for drawing in- and out-group boundaries along this divide. Based on an original survey from Switzerland, a paradigmatic case of electoral realignment, we show that voters' ``objective'' socio-demographic characteristics relate to distinctive, primarily culturally connoted identities. We then inquire into the degree to which these group identities have been politicized, that is, whether they divide new left and far right voters. Our results strongly suggest that the universalism-particularism ``cleavage'' not only bundles issues, but shapes how people think about who they are and where they stand in a group conflict that meshes economics and culture.},

We also show that a perfect balance on pre-treatment outcomes does not generally imply an approximate balance for all covariates, even when they are all relevant. Our results have important implications for the implementation of the method.},

These shares have varied systematically over the post-World War II period, rising until the late 1970s and then falling until now. Explanations for the decline in labor's share include technical progress, globalization and a decline in labor's bargaining power, but none of these explanations can account for both the rise and the decline of labor shares over time and for the similar pattern in developed and developing countries. However, movements in oil prices can account for these movements if energy is included in the production function.

The most common way of examining the determinants of satisfaction with democracy is null hypothesis significance testing. While this approach has merit, this paper argues that the literature, as it stands, can be complemented to gain additional insights. To date, little research has focused on what variables best predict satisfaction. This is important because it helps guide researchers when determining which features to give attention to when devising theories about what causes (changes) in satisfaction. In this paper, I use machine learning algorithms to determine and evaluate the predictive power of variables identified as important in literature. Drawing on the sixth round of the European Social Survey, I find satisfaction with the economy, procedural fairness and responsiveness to be the most important predictors of satisfaction with democracy. These findings justify a stronger focus on the latter two topics in future studies of satisfaction with democracy, which has received little attention in the scholarly literature.},

In part, this is because empirical evidence is largely confined to OECD countries and to the post-1990 period. This chapter introduces a new index of labour market regulation rigidity covering 140 countries from 1960 to 2005. We find that trade liberalization and development level are more powerful explanations for the dynamics of labour market reform than the more conventional `legal origins'. We also find that the rigidity of employment protection legislation reduces income inequality but its effects on economic growth are ambiguous.},

  abstract = {Reforms in labour and product markets play a central role in government policies. The issue of whether structural reforms lead to higher economic growth remains controversial. Researchers in this field tend to agree on the positive role that reforms could play in driving growth as a result of efficiency gains and technological progress. However, reforms may have some negative impacts. One concern is about the timing: structural reforms may not be effective but turn out to be negative when the economy is in a recession and demand is weak. The other concern is structural reforms may lead to income inequality which weakens political support for further reforms. These topics have, in the context of globalization and European integration, attracted great research interest among scholars. This book provides an assessment of past progress and takes stock of current frontier work. It brings together leading contributions from academia, the central banks in Europe, and the OECD. We are convinced that some structural reforms can make a fundamental contribution to improving economic performance across Europe as well as to promoting European integration. Yet we believe that comprehensive, critical, and non-dogmatic assessments of the costs and benefits of different reform programmes are key to guiding future policies. This will allow us to identify the conditions under which structural reforms are beneficial. We believe that future research requires a substantial shift from evaluating generalized direct impacts of structural reforms on economic growth to a broader set of issues and research questions.},

However, in many cases, information about the policy of interest is available from different ("source") regions where a similar policy has already been implemented. In this paper, we propose a novel method of using such data from source regions to predict a new policy in a target region. Instead of relying on extrapolation of a structural relationship using a parametric specification, we formulate a transferability condition and construct a synthetic outcome-policy relationship such that it is as close as possible to meeting the condition. The synthetic relationship weighs both the similarity in distributions of observables and in structural relationships. We develop a general procedure to construct asymptotic confidence intervals for counterfactual predictions and prove its asymptotic validity. We then apply our proposal to predict average teenage employment in Texas following a counterfactual increase in the minimum wage.},

Nevertheless, recent studies have underlined that the usual indicator of wage share, by estimating labour remuneration of self-employed workers very badly, overestimates the French wage share decrease after 1990. By using a disaggregated method (at a sectoral level) to asses labour remuneration of self-employed, these studies conclude that French wage share did not drop as much as usual method could suggest.{$<$}br /{$>$}However, this disaggregated method, by calculating labour remuneration of self-employed on the base of employees' one, overestimates itself the French wage share increase during the 1970s. We eventually present a third method of calculation, according to which French wage share would have remained, after 1990, quite below its level of the beginning of the 1970s.

We apply the proposed simultaneous approach to produce distributional indicators for four Euro-Area countries that are consistent with their national accounts. In particular, we use data from the 2014 Finnish, French, German, and Italian Household Finance and Consumption Survey and rich list data from Forbes or national press sources, along with household sector aggregates from national accounts, as auxiliary sources of information. A bootstrap procedure is also applied to evaluate the precision of the final estimates.},

Nevertheless, the Mariel influx appears to have had virtually no effect on the wages or unemployment rates of less-skilled workers, even among Cubans who had immigrated earlier. The author suggests that the ability of Miami's labor market to rapidly absorb the Mariel immigrants was largely owing to its adjustment to other large waves of immigrants in the two decades before the Mariel Boatlift.},

First, existing evidence is inconsistent with the assumption---ubiquitous in this line of research---of a universal distaste for sharing resources with people who are culturally, ethnically, and racially different. Second, important historical and institutional differences between the United States and Europe preclude any straightforward transposition of the American experience to the European case.

After theoretical description of the model, I present npsynth, the command I developed for estimating the nonparametric synthetic control method proposed in this article. Using both simulated and real data, I set out a comparison of the performance of the parametric and nonparametric methods and widely discuss the results.},

  abstract = {We use machine learning techniques on textual data to identify financial crises. The onset of a crisis and its duration have implications for real economic activity, and as such can be valuable inputs into macroprudential, monetary, and fiscal policy. The academic literature and the policy realm rely mostly on expert judgment to determine crises, often with a lag. Consequently, crisis durations and the buildup phases of vulnerabilities are usually determined only with the benefit of hindsight. Although we can identify and forecast a portion of crises worldwide to various degrees with traditional econometric techniques and using readily available market data, we find that textual data helps in reducing false positives and false negatives in out-of-sample testing of such models, especially when the crises are considered more severe. Building a framework that is consistent across countries and in real time can benefit policymakers around the world, especially when international coordination is required across different government policies.},

  abstract = {Summary             This paper estimates the effect of nonpharmaceutical intervention policies on public health during the COVID-19 outbreak by considering a counterfactual case for Sweden. Using a synthetic control approach, I find that strict initial lockdown measures play an important role in limiting the spread of the COVID-19 infection, as the infection cases in Sweden would have been reduced by almost 75 percent had its policymakers followed stricter containment policies. As people dynamically adjust their behaviour in response to information and policies, the impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions becomes visible, with a time lag of around 5 weeks. Supplementary robustness checks and an alternative difference-in-differences framework analysis do not fundamentally alter the main conclusions. Finally, extending the analysis to excess mortality, I find that the lockdown measures would have been associated with a lower excess mortality rate in Sweden by 25 percentage points, with a steep age gradient of 29 percentage points for the most vulnerable elderly cohort. The outcome of this study can assist policymakers in laying out future guidelines to further protect public health, as well as facilitate plans for economic recovery.},

  abstract = {Abstract             We investigate the properties of a systematic bias that arises in the synthetic control estimator in panel data settings with finite pre-treatment periods, offering intuition and guidance to practitioners. The bias comes from matching to idiosyncratic error terms (noise) in the treated unit and the donor units' pre-treatment outcome values. This in turn leads to a biased counterfactual for the post-treatment periods. We use Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the determinants of the bias in terms of error term variance, sample characteristics and DGP complexity, providing guidance as to which situations are likely to yield more bias. We also offer a procedure to reduce the bias using a direct computational bias-correction procedure based on re-sampling from a pilot model that can reduce the bias in empirically feasible implementations. As a final potential solution, we compare the performance of our corrections to that of an Interactive Fixed Effects model. An empirical application focused on trade liberalization indicates that the magnitude of the bias may be economically meaningful in a real world setting.},

The main finding is the existence of relatively homogeneous global cultural clusters, the Anglosphere and Northern European nations showing the highest appreciation for free markets, followed by the Sinosphere. The rest of the world tends to be more anti-capitalist, with the Middle East and Eastern Europe standing out for being at the end of the spectrum. Statistical analysis suggests that the capitalist mentality is to some extent autonomous, and does not seem to be determined strongly by other variables such as income, growth or inequality. At the same time, the capitalistic mentality appears to correlate with economic freedom, as measured by the Economic Freedom of the World index. If a pro-capitalist ideology is connected to institutional development, then some conglomerates seem to be in a better position to attain or maintain economic growth in the future.},

In the section on models of preference aggregation, we focus on the themes of exogenous candidacy, policy commitment, and the role of valence attributes. For information aggregation, we analyze how different aspects of the institutional environment affect aggregation, focusing on the structure of elections---whether simultaneous or sequential---and the number of choices, as well as the motivations of voters. Finally, in considering models of asymmetric information, we describe how these models shed new light on incumbency effects, campaign spending, and the policy choices of politicians.},

We therefore look at episodes of structural reforms over three decades across forty OECD and EU countries and link them to these factors. Our results suggest that structural reforms implementation is more likely during deep recessions and when unemployment rates are high. Moreover, the further it is distant from best practice, the more likely a country is to implement reforms. External pressures, such as being subject to a financial assistance programme, or being part of the European Single Market facilitated pro-competitive reforms. Low interest rates tend to promote rather than discourage structural reforms, while there seems no clear link between fiscal policy and reforms. Moreover, reforms in product markets tend to increase the likelihood of labour market reforms following suit. Many robustness checks have been carried out confirming our main results.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The current System of National Accounts (SNA) Gross Domestic Product (GDP) concept does not measure the income generated by the production sector since it includes depreciation and excludes capital gains and losses on assets used in the production sector. The paper suggests an accounting framework that measures the income generated by the production sector of an economy and implements this measure using the Augmented Productivity Database (APDB) developed by Asian Productivity Organization and Keio University for China over the years 1970--2020. Real gross and real net income generated by the Chinese production sector are decomposed into explanatory factors including TFP growth using the framework suggested by Jorgenson and Diewert and Morrison. TFP growth is further decomposed into technical progress and inefficiency components using the nonparametric approach developed by Diewert and Fox. The APDB has estimates for the price and quantity of agricultural, industrial, commercial, and residential land used in China. The paper argues that changes in land use should be treated in the same manner as inventory change and added to the alternative output measures. It turns out that Jorgensonian user costs for land are frequently negative. The problems associated with negative user costs are discussed in the paper.},

(J Am Stat Assoc 105:493-505, 2010, Am J Polit Sci, 59:495-510, 2015). However, the evidence obtained with this method is not overly consistent, leading to the conclusion that the method is not too robust to different settings of the adjustment screws. Using a new method developed by Harvey \& Thiele (J Appl Econ 36:71--85, 2021) based on structural time series models, I find that France and Italy are clear losers from the euro while there are no real winners until 2019. Spain, Netherlands, Greece gain in the period before the financial crisis, but afterwards they lose. In fact, only the German economy is robust to the two crises but it loses until 2008. Relating the theories of optimum currency areas to the estimated gaps of the euro adopters from their synthetic controls, I find that openness, real convergence, and net migration are the main drivers of gains from a euro adoption, while the main drivers of losses are low levels of competitiveness, fiscal instability and labour market rigidity. Examining the crisis channels of the financial and euro crisis shows that fiscal instability, labour market rigidity and also business cycle synchronization cause large losses during the crises. Net migration helps to dampen these shocks. While openness is beneficial during the pre-crises period, it cannot help dampen the shock of the crises.},

  abstract = {Numerous studies have analysed the decline in the labour share of income, but only few have linked it to the increase in financialisation. The process of financialisation can roughly be described as an increasing importance of the financial sector that had an impact on the distribution between wages and profits, on the one hand, and retained earnings and financial income in the form of dividends and interests, on the other hand. This article seeks to explore the relationship between financialisation and labour's share of income using a time-series cross-sectional dataset of 13 countries over the time period from 1986 until 2007. The results suggest that there is indeed a relationship between increasing dividend and interest payments of non-financial corporations and the decline of the share of wages in national income. Other factors that can account for the decline relate to globalisation and a decrease in the bargaining power of labour.}

Our results suggest that the alleged non-observation bias is considerable, accounting forabout one quarter of total net wealth in the case of Austria.

Like differential saving rates, differential rates of return matter for post Keynesian theory, because they impact the income and wealth distribution and add an explosive element to growth models. We show that differential rates of return matter empirically by merging data on household balance sheets with long-run returns for individual asset categories. We find that (a) the composition of wealth differentiates three socioeconomic groups: 30\% are asset-poor, 65\% are middle-class home owners, and the top 5\% are business-owning capitalists; (b) rates of return rise across all groups; and (c) rates of return broadly follow a log-shaped function across the distribution, where inequality in the lower half of the distribution is higher than in the upper half. If socioeconomic groups are collapsed into the bottom 95\% workers and top 5\% capitalists, then rates of return are 5.6\% for the former and 7.2\% for the latter.},

  abstract = {In this review, we focus on political inequality in rich democracies. In the two main sections, we look at participation and representation, respectively. The former discusses whether rising income inequality and the weakening of trade unions have led to higher levels of inequality in participation. The latter looks at substantive and descriptive representation and asks how they might be linked. Research highlights that people with fewer individual resources participate much less than those with more resources, and collective organizations lose their ability to counter these trends. In terms of representation, the pattern is very similar. Not only are the opinions of decision-makers more congruent with those of the better off but policy choices also reflect their preferences more clearly. As the social distance between rulers and ruled increases, representative democracy gets more biased in favor of higher-status social groups.},

  abstract = {The effects of the introduction of the euro have been broadly studied by scholars in several fields. Recently, research has shifted its focus to the effects of the euro on income inequality in euro-adopting countries. This research commonly argues that the introduction of the euro negatively affected welfare state generosity which in turn negatively affects the inequality of income. However, the effect of the EMU on welfare state generosity has not been studied in detail. Therefore, this paper sets out to answer the question of whether welfare state generosity in EMU countries would have been higher or lower than its current levels, had these countries not adopted the euro as their currency. Using the synthetic control method developed by Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003), I estimate what would have happened to welfare generosity, had the euro not been introduced. The synthetic control method constructs a synthetic counterfactual for each euro-adopting country from a pool of donor countries and thus provides a counterfactual answer to the question of how the adoption of the euro influenced welfare state generosity in EMU countries. Overall, I find no strong evidence supporting the expectation that the introduction of the euro lowered welfare state generosity. This result challenges a widespread assumption about the impact of the euro on welfare states.},

We contrast data from recent EU-SILC and HFCS waves with Eurostat national accounts for single components of capital income. We find a considerable gap between micro and macro data even when carefully considering comparability issues. On average, EU-SILC and HFCS cover only 26\% and 22\% of national accounts totals in the Eurozone countries. We further assess which amount of this gap that can be traced back to (a) the undercoverage of the top in survey data and (b) general underreporting of capital income across the distribution. To calculate augmented capital incomes, we utilize wealth information from HFCS and apply Pareto estimations and varying rates of return to capital.}

We document a number of novel results. First, individuals earn markedly different average returns on their net worth (a standard deviation of 22.1\%) and on its components. Second, heterogeneity in returns does not arise merely from differences in the allocation of wealth between safe and risky assets: returns are heterogeneous even within narrow asset classes. Third, returns are positively correlated with wealth: moving from the 10th to the 90th percentile of the net worth distribution increases the return by 18 percentage points (and 10 percentage points if looking at net-of-tax returns). Fourth, individual wealth returns exhibit substantial persistence over time. We argue that while this persistence partly arises from stable differences in risk exposure and assets scale, it also reflects heterogeneity in sophistication and financial information, as well as entrepreneurial talent. Finally, wealth returns are correlated across generations. We discuss the implications of these findings for several strands of the wealth inequality debate.},

However, based on Monte Carlo simulations and simulations with real datasets, we show significant room for specification searching when the number of pre-treatment periods is in line with common SC applications, and when alternative specifications commonly used in SC applications are also considered. This suggests that such lack of guidance generates a substantial level of discretion in the choice of the comparison units in SC applications, undermining one of the advantages of the method. We provide recommendations to limit the possibilities for specification searching in the SC method. Finally, we analyze the possibilities for specification searching and provide our recommendations in a series of empirical applications.},

We focus primarily on the facts about, and explanations for, the mid-2000s labor-productivity slowdown in large European countries and the United States. Slower total factor productivity (TFP) growth was the proximate cause of the slowdown. This conclusion is robust to measurement challenges including the role of intangible assets, rankings of productivity levels, and data revisions. We contrast two main narratives for the stagnating TFP frontier: The shock of the Global Financial Crisis; and a common slowdown in TFP trends. Distinguishing these two empirically is hard, but the pre-recession timing of the U.S. slowdown suggests an important role for the common-trend explanation. We also discuss the unusual pattern of labor productivity growth since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Although it is early, there is little evidence so far that the large pandemic shock has changed the slow pre-pandemic trajectory of labor-productivity growth.},

First, we propose parametric weights for the p-value that includes the equal weights benchmark of Abadie et\,al. [1]. By changing the value of this parameter, we can analyze the sensitivity of the test's result to deviations from the equal weights benchmark. Second, we modify the               RMSPE               statistic to test any               sharp null hypothesis               , including, as a specific case, the               null hypothesis of no effect whatsoever               analyzed by Abadie et\,al. [1]. Based on this last extension, we invert the test statistic to estimate confidence sets that quickly show the point-estimates' precision, and the test's significance and robustness. We also extend these two tools to other test statistics and to problems with multiple outcome variables or multiple treated units. Furthermore, in a Monte Carlo experiment, we find that the               RMSPE               statistic has good properties with respect to size, power and robustness.

I use national accounts as a benchmark to evaluate the scope of household surveys, for a number of countries, and tax data for the United States. Due to both measurement error and conceptual differences, capital income is always more underestimated. In most countries, the gap grows during the last two decades. Based on accounting identities, I show that inequality estimates are likely affected in level, trend and composition. Surveys thus largely exaggerate the impact of changes in the labour income distribution, while they undermine the capital share and its dynamics. As a reference, in a panel of nineteen countries, households collect half of total capital income, as opposed to corporations; but surveys only capture close to twenty percent of that half, versus seventy percent of total labour income. For any quantile group --e.g. the top 10\% or bottom 50\% share-- a unit increase of its labour income share translates into an increase of nine tenths of a unit in the overall share, for capital income, the effect is only one tenth of a unit. Gaps are narrower but still present in tax data.},

While increasing attention has been given to the so-called second dimension of European electoral politics, we highlight the relatively limited focus on structural changes that are helping to drive this transformation. We identify some socio-demographic developments that are potentially generating new cleavages in Western European democracies: the expansion of higher education; mass migration and the growing ethnic diversity of electorates; the aging of societies and sharpening of generational divides; and increased geographical segregation of populations between prospering, globalized major cities and declining hinterlands.},

To identify exogenous reductions in regional public spending, we use a Bartik-type instrument that combines regional sensitivities to changes in national government expenditures with narrative national consolidation episodes. Fiscal consolidations lead to a significant increase in extreme parties' vote share, lower voter turnout, and a rise in political fragmentation. We highlight the close relationship between detrimental economic developments and voters' support for extreme parties by showing that austerity induces severe deconomic costs through lowering GDP, employment, private investment, and wages. Austerity-driven recessions amplify the political costs of economic downturns considerably by increasing distrust in the political environment.},

  abstract = {Measuring and understanding the evolution of wealth inequality is a key challenge for researchers, policy makers, and the general public. This paper breaks new ground on this topic by presenting a new method to estimate and study wealth inequality. This method combines fiscal data with household surveys and national accounts in order to provide annual wealth distribution series, with detailed breakdowns by percentiles, age, and assets. Using the case of France as an illustration, we show that the resulting series can be used to better analyze the evolution and the determinants of wealth-inequality dynamics over the 1970--2014 period. We show that the decline in wealth inequality ends in the early 1980s, marking the beginning of a rise in the top 1\% wealth share, though with significant fluctuations due largely to asset price movements. Rising inequality in savings rates coupled with highly stratified rates of returns has led to rising wealth concentration in spite of the opposing effect of house price increases. We develop a simple simulation model highlighting how changes in the combination of unequal savings rates, rates of return, and labor earnings that occurred in the early 1980s generated large multiplicative effects that led to radically different steady-state levels of wealth inequality. Taking advantage of the joint distribution of income and wealth, we show that top wealth holders are almost exclusively top capital earners, and increasingly fewer are made up of top labor earners; it has become increasingly difficult in recent decades to access top wealth groups with one's labor income only.},

That is, we combine national accounts, tax and survey data in a comprehensive and consistent manner to build homogenous annual series on the distribution of national income by percentiles over the 1900--2014 period, with detailed breakdown by age, gender and income categories over the 1970--2014 period. Our DINA-based estimates allow for a much richer analysis of the long-run pattern found in previous tax-based series, i.e. a long-run decline in income inequality, largely due to a sharp drop in the concentration of wealth and capital income following the 1914--1945 capital shocks. First, our new series deliver higher inequality levels than the usual tax-based series for the recent decades, because the latter miss a rising part of capital income. Growth incidence curves look dramatically different for the 1950--1983 and 1983--2014 sub-periods. We also show that gender inequality in labor income declined in recent decades, albeit fairly slowly among top labor incomes. E.g. female share among top 0.1\% earners was only 12\% in 2012 (vs. 7\% in 1994 and 5\% in 1970). Finally, we find that distributional changes can have large impact on comparisons of well-being across countries. E.g. average pretax income among bottom 50\% adults is 20\% larger in France than in the U.S., in spite of the fact that aggregate per adult national income is 30\% smaller in France.},

Europe is characterized by real wage rigidity, while the US is characterized by nominal wage rigidity.  This leads to the conclusion that, in the absence of international policy coordination, the European fiscal stance and US monetary growth have been too tight, while the US fiscal stance has been too loose.  It is shown that treating Europe as one bloc characterized by real wage rigidity may be too simple and lead to counterproductive policy conclusions.  The Mundell-Fleming model is explained briefly, and the importance of the wage mechanism in determining the sign of various transmission effects is made clear.  Some evidence on the real wage gap of the Netherlands shows that, to some extent, nominal wages are flexible only in an upward direction.  It is concluded that, at the moment, a shift of US policy toward fiscal contraction and monetary expansion would not be as beneficial to Europe as it was some years ago.},

We exploit a new database on the socioeconomic determinants of the vote, covering more than 300 elections held between 1948 and 2020. In the 1950s and 1960s, the vote for social democratic, socialist, and affiliated parties was associated with lower-educated and low-income voters. It has gradually become associated with higher-educated voters, giving rise in the 2010s to a disconnection between the effects of income and education on the vote: higher-educated voters now vote for the ``left,'' while high-income voters continue to vote for the ``right.'' This transition has been accelerated by the rise of green and anti-immigration movements, whose distinctive feature is to concentrate the votes of the higher-educated and lower-educated electorates. Combining our database with historical data on political parties' programs, we provide evidence that the reversal of the education cleavage is strongly linked to the emergence of a new ``sociocultural'' axis of political conflict.},

Political scientists have recently closely examined the decline of the center-left and the rise of the radical right but have paid less attention to the weakening of center-right parties. Yet cohesive center-right parties have facilitated political stability and compromises, while their disintegration has empowered radical challengers. After presenting an overview of right-wing politics in Western democracies and weighing different definitions of the electoral right, we discuss two factors that shape variations in center-right cohesion: organizational robustness of center-right partisan institutions and the (un)bundling of conservative mass attitudes on different policy dimensions. Last, we argue that a full account of the rise of the radical right cannot focus solely on the strategies of the center-left but must incorporate also the choices, opportunities, and constraints of center-right parties.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The Synthetic Control Method (SCM) has become a widely used tool in both identifying and estimating the causal impact of policies, shocks, and interventions of interest on economic and social outcomes. The technique has become particularly popular in estimating the effect of these shocks on a single treated unit. As a transparent and data-driven statistical technique, the goal of the SCM is to construct an artificial control group for the treated unit that has similar pretreatment characteristics but has not undergone the treatment itself thus developing a plausible counterfactual against which impacts resulting from structural changes can be evaluated as part of a historical investigation. The method works well when the control group balances pre-intervention outcomes and auxiliary covariates as much as possible. In spite of its widespread adoption, the use of the SCM in comparative economic history has lagged behind other areas of economics. In this article, we critically review the properties of the SCM and discuss the necessary conditions for a plausible application of the technique to comparative economic history in support of research designed to answer some of the long-running historical questions and demonstrate the potential to use SCM in comparative economic history studies by estimating the impact of the oil discovery in the 1920s on Venezuela's long-term economic growth.},

A few interesting findings emerge from analysing the data. Unlike previous US immigration experience in the 1980s, the flow of recent Venezuelan refugees into the United States is characterized by an inflow of highly educated individuals with a college education. The finding of the analysis also suggests that the location choice of these refugees within the United States is not mainly driven by labour market conditions in the destination cities. Rather, distance to home country and climatic difference with Venezuela are the main factors in determining the flow of Venezuelan refugees into a particular US city. Consistent with this finding, most Venezuelan refugees choose to settle only in two cities in Florida: Miami and Orlando. Examining the labour market conditions in Miami and Orlando following the flow of Venezuelan refugees, the results of the analysis show a lack of evidence that the labour force participation, unemployment rate and weekly wages of US natives are adversely affected by the inflow.},

In many settings where it is applicable, researchers want to identify causal effects of policy changes on a treated unit at an aggregate level while having access to data at a finer granularity. This article proposes an extension of the synthetic controls estimator that takes advantage of this additional structure and provides nonparametric estimates of the heterogeneity within the aggregate unit. The idea is to replicate the quantile function associated with the treated unit by a weighted average of quantile functions of the control units. This estimator relies on the same mathematical theory as the changes-in-changes estimator and can be applied in both repeated cross-sections and panel data with as little as a single pre-treatment period. It also provides a unique counterfactual quantile function for any type of distribution.},

This paper analyzes the role of three factors in explaining movements in labor's share--factor-biased technological progress, openness to trade, and changes in employment protection--using a panel of 18 industrial countries over 1960-2000. Since most studies suggest that globalization and rapid technological progress (associated with accelerated information technology development) began in the mid-1980s, the sample is split in 1985 into preglobalization/pre-IT revolution and postglobalization/post-IT revolution eras. The results suggest that the decline in labor's share during the past few decades in the OECD member countries may have been largely an equilibrium, rather than a cyclical, phenomenon, as the distribution of national income between labor and capital adjusted to capital-augmenting technological progress and a more globalized world economy.}

Our new Distributional National Accounts allow to correct for remarkable misreporting of capital income in surveys, to provide more accurate estimates of consumption, and to better account for the role of informal economy. Our fresh estimates show higher income concentration at the top 1\% and 0.1\% with respect to previous studies in order of 1.5 percentage points. Moreover, the share of national income of the richest top 10\%, top 1\%, and top 0.1\% has been steadily increasing after the 2008 crisis. Our results shed further light on the multifaceted nature of inequality in Italy: youngest individuals, women, and inhabitants of Southern regions have been increasingly exposed to growing levels of inequality. Finally, the Italian tax system is only slightly progressive up to the 95th percentile of the income distribution, and regressive for the top 5\%. Moreover, it is regressive throughout the whole distribution when individuals are ranked with respect to their net wealth.},

We argue that the success of far right parties depends on their ability to mobilize a coalition of interests between their core supporters, that is voters with cultural grievances over immigration and the often larger group of voters with economic grievances over immigration. Using individual level data from eight rounds of the European Social Survey, our empirical analysis shows that while cultural concerns over immigration are a stronger predictor of far right party support, those who are concerned with the impact of immigration on the economy are important to the far right in numerical terms. Taken together, our findings suggest that economic grievances over immigration remain pivotal within the context of the transnational cleavage.},

Through a novel consumption deflator decomposition, we show that import prices account for 40 percent of the average change in the consumption deflator over 2022Q1 -- 2023Q1, while domestic profits account for 45 percent. The increase in nominal profits was largest in sectors benefiting from increasing international commodity prices and those exposed to recent supply-demand mismatches. While the results show that firms have passed on more than the nominal cost shock, and have fared relatively better than workers, the limited available data does not point to a widespread increase in markups. Looking ahead, assuming nominal wage growth of around 4.5 percent over 2023-24 -- slightly below the level seen in Q1 2023 -- and broadly unchanged productivity, a normalization of the profit share to the average level over 2015-19 will be necessary to achieve a convergence of inflation to target over the next two years. Monetary policy will thus need to remain restrictive to anchor expectations and maintain subdued demand such that workers and firms settle on relative price setting that is consistent with disinflation.},

Synthesizing the literature, we propose a definition of growth and welfare regimes that integrates different engines of growth as a way to track general trends in the evolution of capitalism. We analyze the main trends of three eras of capitalism: Fordism, neoliberal financialization, and the digitalized knowledge-based economy. We trace the various paths of change by identifying the five growth strategies governments have pursued to adapt their growth and welfare regimes to the new capitalist era. The result is not a typology of fixed types of capitalist models but a dynamic process of adjustment.},

  abstract = {Nominal wage growth in most advanced economies remains markedly lower than it was before the Great Recession of 2008--09. This chapter finds that the bulk of the wage slowdown can be explained by labor market slack (both headline unemployment and underutilization of labor in the form of involuntary part-time employment), inflation expectations, and trend productivity growth. While involuntary part-time employment may have helped support labor force participation and facilitated stronger engagement with the workplace than the alternative of unemployment, it also appears to have weakened wage growth. This is the case even in economies where measured slack appears low (that is, headline unemployment rates are now at, or below, their averages in the years leading up to the recession). Common factors---beyond slack, productivity, and price inflation---have also exerted downward pressure on wages in recent years, suggesting that the synchronized nature of excess capacity across countries may have amplified its effects. While accommodative policies can help lift demand and lower headline unemployment rates, wage growth may continue to remain subdued until involuntary part-time employment diminishes or trend productivity growth picks up. Inflation rates will also likely remain low unless wage growth accelerates beyond productivity growth in a sustained manner. Assessing the true degree of slack beyond measured headline unemployment rates will be important when judging the appropriate pace of exit from accommodative monetary policies.},

  abstract = {Most work on redistribution in democracies is anchored in long-standing unidimensional models, notably the seminal Meltzer-Richard-Romer model. When scholars venture outside the security of unidimensionality, many either abandon theoretical rigor or miss the full consequences of adding more dimensions (whether ideological or economic). There is now a substantial literature on redistributive politics in multidimensional policy spaces, but it tends to be very technical and frequently misinterpreted, if not ignored. This purpose of this article is to review this relatively new literature using simple graphical representations, focusing on the key assumptions, intuitions, and results. We show how issue bundling, issue salience, and the distribution of preferences can affect redistribution, and we discuss the role of political institutions in inducing particular outcomes. We also highlight the opportunities for dialogue between formal models and more constructivist approaches by exploring the effects of political entrepreneurs manipulating salience, institutions, and even identities.},

This article reviews the growing literature on inflation inequality, describing recent advances and opportunities for further research in four areas. First, new price index theory facilitates the study of inflation inequality. Second, new data show that inflation rates decline with household income in the United States. Accurate measurement requires granular price and expenditure data because of aggregation bias. Third, new evidence quantifies the impacts of innovation and trade on inflation inequality. Contrary to common wisdom, empirical estimates show that the direction of innovation is a significant driver of inflation inequality in the United States, whereas trade has similar price effects across the income distribution. Fourth, inflation inequality and non-homotheticities have important policy implications. They transform cost-benefit analysis, optimal taxation, the effectiveness of stabilization policies, and our understanding of secular macroeconomic trends?including structural change, the decline in the labor share and interest rates, and labor market polarization.},

Relative to outlying regions of the state identified by the synthetic control method, aggregate employment at wages less than twice the original minimum---measured by total hours worked---declined. A portion of this reduction reflects jobs transitioning to wages above the threshold; the aggregate analysis likely overstates employment effects. Longitudinal analysis of individual Seattle workers matched to counterparts in outlying regions reveals no change in the probability of continued employment but significant reductions in hours, particularly for less experienced workers. Job turnover declined, as did hiring of new workers into low-wage jobs. Analyses suggest aggregate employment elasticities in the range of ---0.2 to ---2.0, concentrated on the intensive margin in the short run and largest among inexperienced workers.

For top income recipients, I estimate inequality and mean income by fitting Pareto models to the tax data, examining specification issues in depth, notably whether to use Pareto~I or Pareto~II (generalized Pareto) models, and the choice of income threshold above which the Pareto models apply. The preferred specification is a Pareto~II model with a threshold set at the 99th or 95th percentile (depending on year). Conclusions about aggregate UK inequality trends since the mid-1990s are robust to the way in which tax data are employed. The Gini coefficient for individual gross income rose by around 7\% or 8\% between 1996/7 and 2007/8, with most of the increase occurring after 2003/4. The corresponding estimate based wholly on the survey data is around -5\%.},

We construct distributional national accounts for the period 2004--2016 by combining survey data, tabulated tax data, and detailed national accounts data. The comprehensive data set allows us to analyze the distribution of macroeconomic income growth across the income distribution and to explore the evolution of income inequality over time. Our results suggest that as the distribution of growth changed over time, this had considerable repercussions for inequality, which started to decline at the very beginning of the economic and financial crisis, but increased again after 2012. We find that capital income largely determined both the level and the dynamics of income inequality. Government spending was found to play a key role for redistributive effects across the income distribution. In particular, in-kind transfers redistributed pre-tax income to a large extent. Our results show further that individuals with lower educational levels and younger individuals faced negative growth in pre-tax income over the years and also benefited considerably from redistribution.},

In this article, we survey election poll performance in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Israel and discuss the current state of the art. We list the main data collection methods used in election surveys, describe a wide range of analysis techniques that can be applied to such data, and expand on the relatively new application of predictive models used in this context. A special section considers sources of error in election surveys followed by an introduction and a general discussion of an information quality framework for studying them.

This scheme, introduced in 1991, allows new immigrants with high earnings to be taxed at a preferential flat rate for a duration of three years. We obtain two main results. First, the scheme has doubled the number of highly paid foreigners in Denmark relative to slightly less paid---and therefore ineligible---foreigners. This translates into a very large elasticity of migration with respect to 1 minus the average tax rate on foreigners, between 1.5 and 2. Second, we find compelling evidence of a negative effect of the scheme-induced reduction in the average tax rate on pretax earnings of foreign migrants at the individual level. This finding can be rationalized by a matching frictions model with wage bargaining where there is a gap between pay and marginal productivity.},

And how effective is the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP)? Do the euro countries generally fail to comply with the rules of fiscal governance, or does the eurozone need a more member-specific fiscal mechanism? This article examines whether and how the SGP influenced the development of government debt making in the euro countries after the introduction of the common currency. While the SGP could not prevent euro countries from exceeding their deficits, this study's synthetic control analysis reveals that the mechanism has effectively reduced the overall government debt of euro countries since 1999. In particular, donor countries were able to control governmental spending, while many recipient countries---including Greece, Portugal and Italy---have increased government debt ever since, resulting in the European sovereign debt crisis. This suggests that while the SGP effectively constrained overall government debt making, a more sophisticated mechanism is required for safeguarding compliance in large recipient countries.},

Methods               Utilizing a 50-nation panel containing annual suicide counts and population demographics for the years 1995--2015 from the World Health Organization's Mortality archive, the analysis employs a synthetic control design, a quasi-experimental approach that allows us to causally model the relationship between Greece's International Monetary Fund-imposed austerity measures and suicide, something that has hampered prior research efforts.

C'est ainsi depuis des mill{\'e}naires et c'est m{\^e}me encadr{\'e} par la loi, notamment {\`a} travers les frais de succession. Mais c'est aussi, selon beaucoup d'{\'e}conomistes, l'un des moyens de reproduction des in{\'e}galit{\'e}s {\'e}conomiques et sociales les plus importants qui existent. En~2014, pour illustrer cette id{\'e}e, deux chercheurs ont voulu mesurer l'influence de la famille dans la reproduction sociale. Ils ont donc {\'e}tudi{\'e} l'origine familiale des membres de l'{\'e}lite anglaise contemporaine et celle de membres de l'{\'e}lite anglaise au XIIe~si{\`e}cle. 800~ans et 28 g{\'e}n{\'e}rations plus tard, ils ont conclu que l'{\'e}lite anglaise {\'e}tait encore issue des m{\^e}mes familles. Une autre {\'e}tude publi{\'e}e en~2016 et consacr{\'e}e {\`a} la reproduction des {\'e}lites dans la ville de Florence, en Italie, est arriv{\'e}e aux m{\^e}mes conclusions.

We can confirm a significant impact of non-cash income and find an inequality-decreasing effect for the unconditional income distribution which highly correlates with the proportion of owner-occupiers in the respective countries. However, aggregated inequality measures are not suited to analyze the increase in the conditional income inequality between owner-occupiers and renters, who do not obtain income from imputed rents by definition. Therefore, we apply a reweighting decomposition that controls for the heterogeneous housing characteristics among European countries and allows us to decompose the distributional changes into a part that is explained by the proportion of tenure types and household size and a remaining part that reflects the relative dispersion of imputed rents along the income distribution.},

  abstract = {This work in progress aims to provide a unified introduction to statistical learning, building up slowly from classical models like the GMM and HMM to modern neural networks like the VAE and diffusion models. There are today many internet resources that explain this or that new machine-learning algorithm in isolation, but they do not (and cannot, in so brief a space) connect these algorithms with each other or with the classical literature on statistical models, out of which the modern algorithms emerged. Also conspicuously lacking is a single notational system which, although unfazing to those already familiar with the material (like the authors of these posts), raises a significant barrier to the novice's entry. Likewise, I have aimed to assimilate the various models, wherever possible, to a single framework for inference and learning, showing how (and why) to change one model into another with minimal alteration (some of them novel, others from the literature). Some background is of course necessary. I have assumed the reader is familiar with basic multivariable calculus, probability and statistics, and linear algebra. The goal of this book is certainly not completeness, but rather to draw a more or less straight-line path from the basics to the extremely powerful new models of the last decade. The goal then is to complement, not replace, such comprehensive texts as Bishop's {\textbackslash}emph\{Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning\}, which is now 15 years old.},

Further, the impact of labor share on growth changes sign with the frequency considered from negative at high frequencies to positive at low frequencies. Finally, the positive coefficient associated with the labor share at low frequencies increases over time. JEL Classification: E24, E25, N1},

The presence of labor unions has statistically and economically significant positive effects on firm productivity. Unions' effects on wages are also positive, their magnitude being slightly larger than those on productivity. The decrease in the number of employees is greater at unionized firms than at non-unionized firms. The difference in employment growth is mainly attributable to the change in the number of part-time workers. In order to enhance productivity, close cooperation between management and unions is essential.},

It rests on a crucial assumption that we can write the treated unit as a linear combination of the untreated units. This linearity assumption, however, can be unlikely to hold in practice and, when violated, the resulting SC estimates are incorrect. In this paper we examine two questions: (1) How large can the misspecification error be? (2) How can we limit it? First, we provide theoretical bounds to quantify the misspecification error. The bounds are comforting: small misspecifications induce small errors. With these bounds in hand, we then develop new SC estimators that are specially designed to minimize misspecification error. The estimators are based on additional data about each unit, which is used to produce the SC weights. (For example, if the units are countries then the additional data might be demographic information about each.) We study our estimators on synthetic data; we find they produce more accurate causal estimates than standard synthetic controls. We then re-analyze the California tobacco-program data of the original SC paper, now including additional data from the US census about per-state demographics. Our estimators show that the observations in the pre-treatment period lie within the bounds of misspecification error, and that the observations post-treatment lie outside of those bounds. This is evidence that our SC methods have uncovered a true effect.},

We observe in many countries, and even in the European Parliament, a transformation of the main dimension of politics from the left--right cleavage to a new cleavage opposing the mainstream parties to populist parties. We examine how this transformation relates to changes in voter attitudes and the adjustment of political parties to these changes. Two main types of causes for the rise of populism have emerged: economic and cultural. In reviewing the evidence, we find a complex interaction between economic and cultural factors. Economic anxiety among large groups of voters related to the Great Recession and austerity policies triggers a heightened receptivity to the messages of cultural backlash from populist parties.},

This article empirically examines the motives of workers for supporting a right-wing populist party. Based on data from the European Social Survey for Austria, Belgium, France, Norway, and Switzerland, three different sets of explanations are tested: (1) hypotheses stressing economic determinants, that is, the fear of wage pressure and competition over welfare benefits; (2) hypotheses emphasizing cultural determinants, that is, the perception of immigration as a threat to national identity; and (3) hypotheses focusing on social alienation, that is, dissatisfaction with the way the country's democracy works and the nonintegration into intermediary networks (trade unions). We find questions of community and identity to be clearly more important than economic grievances. Hence, in Austria and Switzerland, the electoral success of right-wing populist parties among workers seems primarily due to cultural protectionism: the defense of national identity against outsiders. In Belgium, France, and Norway, cultural protectionism is complemented by deep-seated discontent with the way the countries' democracies work.},

It examines the development of a new macroeconomic framework, its sectoral variations and the forms of resistance it encounters. From railways to environmental protection, from administrative reforms to economic, budgetary and social policies, the areas under study highlight the tangible yet variable and contrasting effects of neo-liberal practices that are not always the product of a clearly asserted political project.

  abstract = {Synthetic control (SC) models are widely used to estimate causal effects in settings with observational time-series data. To identify the causal effect on a target unit, SC requires the existence of correlated units that are not impacted by the intervention. Given one of these potential donor units, how can we decide whether it is in fact a valid donor - that is, one not subject to spillover effects from the intervention? Such a decision typically requires appealing to strong a priori domain knowledge specifying the units, which becomes infeasible in situations with large pools of potential donors. In this paper, we introduce a practical, theoretically-grounded donor selection procedure, aiming to weaken this domain knowledge requirement. Our main result is a Theorem that yields the assumptions required to identify donor values at post-intervention time points using only pre-intervention data. We show how this Theorem - and the assumptions underpinning it - can be turned into a practical method for detecting potential spillover effects and excluding invalid donors when constructing SCs. Importantly, we employ sensitivity analysis to formally bound the bias in our SC causal estimate in situations where an excluded donor was indeed valid, or where a selected donor was invalid. Using ideas from the proximal causal inference and instrumental variables literature, we show that the excluded donors can nevertheless be leveraged to further debias causal effect estimates. Finally, we illustrate our donor selection procedure on both simulated and real-world datasets.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In some applications, researchers using the synthetic control method (SCM) to evaluate the effect of a policy may struggle to determine whether they have identified a ``good match'' between the control group and treated group. In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of the mean and maximum Absolute Standardized Mean Difference (ASMD) as a test of balance between a synthetic control unit and treated unit, and provide guidance on what constitutes a poor fit when using a synthetic control. We explore and compare other potential metrics using a simulation study. We provide an application of our proposed balance metric to the 2013 Los Angeles (LA) Firearm Study [9]. Using Uniform Crime Report data, we apply the SCM to obtain a counterfactual for the LA firearm-related crime rate based on a weighted combination of control units in a donor pool of cities. We use this counterfactual to estimate the effect of the LA Firearm Study intervention and explore the impact of changing the donor pool and pre-intervention duration period on resulting matches and estimated effects. We demonstrate how decision-making about the quality of a synthetic control can be improved by using ASMD. The mean and max ASMD clearly differentiate between poor matches and good matches. Researchers need better guidance on what is a meaningful imbalance between synthetic control and treated groups. In addition to the use of gap plots, the proposed balance metric can provide an objective way of determining fit.},

This paper argues that the composition of skills in the labor force and an identification of the elasticity parameters between capital and different skills of labor can reconcile the opposing views. Using a framework with capital-skill complementarity and variable substitution elasticities, the Morishima elasticity of substitution is applied to identify the elasticity parameters at different skill levels and derive the necessary condition for capital accumulation to coexist with a declining labor income share when capital and labor are complements. Empirical evidence supports this proposition.},

  abstract = {How has Polish inequality evolved between communism and capitalism to reach one of the highest levels in Europe today? To address this question, we construct the first consistent series on the long-term distribution of income in Poland by combining tax, household survey and national accounts data. We document a U-shaped evolution of inequalities from the end of the 19th century until today: (i) inequality was high before WWII; (ii) abruptly fell after the introduction of communism in 1947 and stagnated at low levels during the whole communist period; (iii) experienced a sharp rise with the return to capitalism in 1989. Between 1989 and 2015 the top 10\% income share increased from 23\% to 35\% and the top 1\% income share from 4\% to 13\%. We find that official survey-based measures strongly under-estimate the rise of inequality since 1989. Our new estimates show that frequently quoted Poland's transition success has largely benefited top income groups. We find that inequality was high in the first half of the 20th century due to strong concentration of capital income at the top of the distribution. The secular fall after WW2 was largely to a combination of capital income shocks from war destructions with communist policies both eliminating private ownership and forcing wage compression. The rise of inequality after the return to capitalism in the early 1990s was induced both by the rise of top labour and capital incomes. However, the strong rise in inequality in the 2000s was driven solely by the increase in top capital incomes, which is likely related to current globalization forces. Yet overall, the unique Polish inequality history speaks about the central role of policies and institutions in shaping inequality in the long run.},

Cet article s'interroge sur les raisons et la signification de l'apparition deformes de n{\'e}gociation nationale qui avaient disparu dans la d{\'e}cennie pr{\'e}c{\'e}dente. L'hypoth{\`e}se de cet article est que la perspective de l'UEM a modifi{\'e} le contexte des relations professionnelles en particulier dans les pays ne faisant pas partie structurellement de la zone mark tels que le Portugal, l'Italie, l'Espagne, la Finlande et l'Irlande, mais aussi la Belgique. Les acteurs sociaux y sont amen{\'e}s {\`a} anticiper les implications de l'UEM surtout en mati{\`e}re d'inflation et de salaire. Cela a favoris{\'e} la centralisation des n{\'e}gociations sur ce th{\`e}me. Une internalisation des variables macro{\'e}conomiques ainsi qu'un r{\'e}agencement des niveaux de la n{\'e}gociation ont eu lieu. Le caract{\`e}re durable ou non de ces pactes reste cependant une question largement ouverte. Since the start of the 1990s, social pacts have been negotiated in various European countries. What are the reasons for, and meanings of, this re-emergence of forms of national negotiation that had disappeared during the 1980s? The prospect of the European Monetary Union has, it is hypothesized, modified the context of labor relations, especially in the lands (Portugal, Italy, Spain, Finland, Ireland and, too, Belgium) that are not a structural part of the mark currency area. The parties to these pacts have been led to anticipate the implications of a single currency for inflation and wages in particular. Negotiations about this have tended to be centralized so as to make it easier to control macroeconomic factors. Macroeconomic variables have thus been internalized; and bargaining levels, shifted. Whether or not these pacts will last is an open question. The coming of the Euro will bring along problems that unions and management have never previously had to face. So far, they have been capable of adjusting the collective bargaining system to the immediate consequences of the monetary union.},

This apparently uniform decrease in labour's share conceals differences amongst states however---in `liberal' Ireland, this fall has been drastic, while that of `social democratic' Denmark has been moderate. This article presents a parallel time series analysis of institutional and structural factors shaping labour's share in Ireland and Denmark. Our results show that factors common to the study of variation in labour's share operate in different ways in different countries, both in magnitude and causal mechanism. We find that stressors such as global trade, foreign investment and high-tech growth produce different effects in each location. Equally, protections such as unionization, leftist cabinets and welfare spending display contradictory effects in both locations. We conclude that `power resource' models of labour share should be supplemented with comparative approaches that emphasize how institutionalized socio-political logics mediate returns to labour.}

I then provide a conceptual framework that identifies four distinct channels through which globalization can stimulate populism, two each on the demand and supply sides of politics. I evaluate the empirical literature with the help of this framework, discussing trade, financial globalization, and immigration separately. I conclude the review by discussing some apparently anomalous cases in which populists have been against, rather than in favor of, trade protection.},

Its primary aim is to unveil the underlying causes, distributive repercussions, and mechanisms through which inflation spreads. We adopt a cost-push and distributive conflict perspective on current inflation. Within this perspective, some contributions argued for a profit-driven inflation, while others dispute this interpretation. They emphasize that increases in profit share or operating surplus, especially amid rising import costs, do not necessarily translate to heightened overall profitability. To disentangle these intricacies, the paper puts forth an analytical framework that clarifies how escalating import costs can elevate profit shares and set in motion inflationary processes, even in the absence of explicit conflicts over income distribution. Turning attention to the Italian context, the study utilizes descriptive statistics, sectoral data, and simple simulations to gain insights into the drivers of inflation and its distributive consequences. Additionally, a Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) model is deployed to uncover the nature and timing of the propagation process. The paper concludes with some policy implications based on the findings.},

The correction is also extended to non-stationary models.

Studies of these taxes sometimes, but not always, find a substantial behavioral response, including of saving, portfolio change, avoidance, and evasion, and the impact depends crucially on design features, especially the broadness of the base and enforcement provisions. Because the US proposals are very different from any previous wealth tax, experience in other countries offers only broad lessons, but we can gain insights from closely related taxes, such as the property and the estate tax, and from optimal tax analysis of the role of wealth taxation.},

Cons{\'e}quence logique, la n{\'e}cessit{\'e} d'intensifier la coordination de l'imposition des entreprises est revenue sur le devant de la sc{\`e}ne. En 2013, l'OCDE --~avec le soutien du G20~-- a lanc{\'e} avec succ{\`e}s son projet Base Erosion and Profit Shifting ({\'e}rosion de la base d'imposition et transfert de b{\'e}n{\'e}fices~--~BEPS).

Le projet~BEPS se d{\'e}cline en 15~points d'action. Le premier de ceux-ci, Tax challenges arising from digitalisation (les d{\'e}fis fiscaux li{\'e}s {\`a} la num{\'e}risation), est actuellement la priorit{\'e} absolue du Cadre inclusif OCDE/G20, qui a donn{\'e} lieu {\`a} une solution reposant sur deux piliers pour relever les d{\'e}fis fiscaux soulev{\'e}s par la num{\'e}risation de l'{\'e}conomie. Pour l'heure, 137~juridictions membres du Cadre inclusif ont approuv{\'e} ces deux piliers, ce qui peut {\^e}tre consid{\'e}r{\'e} comme une {\'e}tape importante de la refonte de la vision g{\'e}n{\'e}rale quant {\`a} la mani{\`e}re dont l'imposition internationale devrait traiter l'{\'e}vasion fiscale et la fraude fiscale.},

  abstract = {I review evidence that individuals associate themselves---or identify---with groups in two fundamental ways: ingroup bias and conformity to group norms. The evidence spans many spheres of economic activity, including consumption, production, hiring, promotion, education, cooperation, financial investments, and law enforcement. Group identities are not fixed, even when it comes to ethnic and religious identities. I argue that the choice of identity can be captured by a simple trade-off between gains from group status and costs to distance from the group. I outline a simple conceptual framework that captures the main empirical regularities and illustrate how it can be used to study the two-way interaction between economic policy and social identity. The analysis implies, e.g., that inequality and immigration of low-skilled workers can strengthen nationalism and reduce redistribution, and that changes in the economic environment can produce shifts in identification patterns that feed into trade policy. Finally, I discuss open theoretical questions and domains where the interaction between identity and economic activity is not well understood. This includes the provision of public services, the evolution of gender norms, and the use of identity to motivate workers.},

The empirical examination is concerned with Switzerland, which stands out as one of the very few developed countries with a stable labor share. Broadly confirming results from previous cross-country and industry-level studies, the authors find that the main factor decreasing the labor share between 2001 and 2010 was the increase in the firm's share of workers using information and communication technology. The main reasons why Switzerland's labor share remained almost constant are the counteracting effects of a relatively slow rate of technological progress in 1980 to 1995 and sectoral reallocation toward industries with above-average labor shares.},

Using random forest analyses in a dataset of N = 4,286 individuals (46.01\% men), separate models were trained to predict intentions to 1) not vote versus to vote, 2) vote for a specific party, and 3) vote for a left- versus right-from-the-center party from either the Big Five personality domains, facets, or nuances (represented by individual items). Except for intentions to not vote versus to vote, balanced accuracies to predict voting intentions marginally exceeded those achieved by a baseline learner always predicting the majority class. Using nuances over facets and domains slightly increased balanced accuracies.

In particular, there is strong evidence that the 2012 labor market reforms increased wage flexibility, which helped the Spanish economy to regain competitiveness and create jobs. But the impact of these labor reforms on income inequality and social inclusion has not been analyzed much. This paper aims to shed light on this issue by employing an econometric decomposition procedure combined with the synthetic control method. The results indicate that the 2012 labor reforms have helped improve employment and income equality outcomes with no substantial impact on the overall risk of poverty. Nevertheless, the reforms appear to have induced a deterioration of average hours worked, in-work poverty, and possibly also of involuntary part-time employment.},

  abstract = {In the last quarter century dramatic changes in income distribution have taken place. This refers to the personal distribution of income as well as to the functional distribution of income. Distribution has become more polarized in most OECD countries (OECD 2008, 2011), with the very top income groups increasing their income shares substantially in the Anglo-Saxon countries, in particular in the United States (Atkinson et al. 2011). Wage shares have fallen in virtually all OECD countries, with decreases typically being more pronounced in continental European countries (and Japan) than in the Anglo-Saxon countries. In the advanced economies1 the (adjusted) wage share has, on average, fallen from 73.4 in 1980 to 64.0 per cent in 2007 (Figure 2.1). The data for Germany are very similar (72.2 to 61.8); the decline is somewhat stronger in Japan (77.2 to 62.2) and a little weaker in the United States (70.0 to 64.9). Overall, real wage growth has clearly lagged behind productivity growth since around 1980. This constitutes a major historical change as wage shares had been stable or increasing in the post-war era.},

The authors apply the Synthetic Control Method (SCM), a matching method for comparative case studies. A counterfactual analysis of the cases studied is performed by combining a control group of several untreated units, which provides a better comparison to the treatment group than a single unit. The control unit is designed as a weighted average of the available cantons in the donor pool, taking into account the similarities between the chosen controls and the treated unit. Once policy changes are controlled, the results suggest a significant effect on the unemployment rate at a cantonal level: the reform had a discernible impact on lowering the unemployment rate in the Italian- and French-speaking cantons in Switzerland.},

Two challenges arise with higher-frequency data (e.g., monthly versus yearly): (i) achieving excellent pretreatment fit is typically more challenging, and (ii) overfitting to noise is more likely. Aggregating data over time can mitigate these problems but can also destroy important signal. In this paper, we bound the bias for SCM with disaggregated and aggregated outcomes and give conditions under which aggregating tightens the bounds. We then propose finding weights that balance both disaggregated and aggregated series.},

In this paper, we instead propose estimating a common set of weights across outcomes, by balancing either a vector of all outcomes or an index or average of them. Under a low-rank factor model, we show that these approaches lead to lower bias bounds than separate weights, and that averaging leads to further gains when the number of outcomes grows. We illustrate this via simulation and in a re-analysis of the impact of the Flint water crisis on educational outcomes.},

I argue that while left and center populist parties have upended existing structures of competition, it is longstanding conservative parties, remodeled using ethnopopulism, that have been the most consequential for the substance of political competition and the trajectory of domestic politics. I consider the behavior of incumbents and argue that varieties of populism should shape our expectations of what happens when populists rule: While left populist parties in power over the last decade have tended to become more ordinary, sometimes even shedding antiestablishment and anti-EU positions, ethnopopulist parties in power have used harsh ``us-versus-them'' appeals, misinformation, and democratic backsliding in their pursuit of more power.},

We adopt an approach that differs from those previously employed in research on motherhood penalties: we follow Hern{\'a}n and Robins, setting up our data as a `target trial', and we analyse it using the Individual Synthetic Control method, based on the Synthetic Control approach of Abadie, Diamond and Hainmueller. We find considerable variation in the effect of motherhood on British women's earnings, but the median penalty is a reduction in medium- and long-term earnings by about 45 per cent relative to what women would have earned if they had remained childless. Motherhood has no effect on average on the income of the woman's household, but has substantial negative effects for some households. Focusing on both individual and household penalties yields a more complete picture of the distributional consequences of motherhood than hitherto.},

Les riches deviendraient toujours plus riches, les pauvres seraient de plus en plus nombreux et le sort de la classe moyenne ne s'am{\'e}liorerait plus, voire se d{\'e}graderait significativement.

Qu'en est-il exactement en Belgique~? Pour r{\'e}pondre {\`a} cette question, C. Valenduc exploite les statistiques relatives aux vingt derni{\`e}res ann{\'e}es. D'une part, il examine comment le revenu global est r{\'e}parti entre le travail et le capital, et comment le champ global de la redistribution {\'e}volue par rapport aux revenus primaires. D'autre part, il analyse la distribution des revenus entre les m{\'e}nages. L'{\'e}tude montre que la situation est nuanc{\'e}e. La vague in{\'e}galitaire n'a pas submerg{\'e} les Belges, mais <<~elle leur a mouill{\'e} les pieds, et m{\^e}me un peu les jambes~>>.

Par ailleurs, il appara{\^i}t que la Belgique r{\'e}siste mieux que d'autres pays {\`a} la mont{\'e}e des in{\'e}galit{\'e}s, notamment au niveau des revenus primaires et de la r{\'e}partition du patrimoine.

Addressing this question would help us better assess normative claims about electoral reforms. Yet, doing so is difficult because of endogeneity issues: party systems are endogenous to many other dynamics in a polity. We overcome this problem by putting forward an instrument for the number of parties in a system, based on the level of fragmentation added by parties that narrowly make it to parliament. We then test the effect of party-system fragmentation on the quality of democracy, drawing upon an extensive battery of outcomes. Against previous literature, we find that a higher number of parties leads to more fractionalized governments, but has no impact on other democratic outcomes. Subsample analyses suggest that fragmentation may have some effect in contexts of very high polarization, but we find no effect in other theoretically meaningful subsamples. Our results indicate that party-system fragmentation may have fewer normative implications than previously assumed.},

We also decompose the capital shares into the income shares of land, structures, and equipment. We find that the capital shares differ across sectors. For example, the capital share of agriculture is more than two times that of construction and more than 50\% larger than that of the aggregate economy. Moreover, agriculture has by far the largest land share, which mostly explains why it has the largest capital share. Our numbers can directly be used to calibrate standard multi-sector models. Alternatively, if one wants to abstract from differences in sector capital shares, our numbers can be used to establish that this is not crucial for the results.},

An important source of this gap may be the under-representation of the wealthiest households in the HFCS. This article therefore combines a semi-parametric Pareto model estimated from top survey data and observations from rich lists with a non-parametric stratification approach to quantify the impact of the missing wealthy households on component-specific micro-macro gaps. We find that unadjusted micro data substantially underestimates wealth inequality. The largest effects are documented for equity. For other components, the missing wealthy explain less than ten percentage points of the micro-macro gap. We find that differences in oversampling strategies limit the cross-country comparability of unadjusted survey-implied wealth distributions and that our top tail adjustment leads to measures that are internationally better comparable.},

I combine data collected in the largely harmonized HFCS survey and adjust for remaining differences in survey modes regarding the treatment of the top tail using (Generalized) Pareto models estimated from rich lists or top wealth shares derived from tax data and leaked information on wealth held in offshore tax havens. Measured inequality increases strongest in countries where surveys refrain from appropriate top-tail corrections.},

This raises the question of how sector-specific shocks are related to overall price stability. This paper simulates price shocks in an input--output model to identify sectors which present systemic vulnerabilities for monetary stability in the United States. We call these prices systemically significant. We find that in our simulations the pre-pandemic average price volatilities and the price shocks in the COVID-19 and Ukraine war inflation yield an almost identical set of systemically significant prices. The sectors with systemically significant prices fall into four groups: energy, basic production inputs other than energy, basic necessities, and commercial infrastructure. Specifically, they are ``Petroleum and coal products,'' ``Oil and gas extraction,'' ``Utilities,'' ``Chemical products,'' ``Farms,'' ``Food and beverage and tobacco products,'' ``Housing,'' and ``Wholesale trade.'' We argue that in times of overlapping emergencies, economic stabilization needs to go beyond monetary policy and requires institutions and policies that can target these systemically significant sectors.},

Using individual data for 25 European countries from 2002 to 2014, I find that increasing inequality leads on average to more support for left-wing parties. I also find that increasing inequality leads to more support for far-right parties among older individuals. Support for far-right parties seems to be driven by rising anti-immigrant sentiments. The results are robust to different specifications, including an instrumental variable that addresses the endogeneity of income inequality.},

Using household-level data from the Survey of Consumer Finances (1989--2019), I provide new empirical evidence on returns to wealth in the United States, and find that wealthier households earn, on average, higher returns: moving from the 20th to the 99th percentile of the wealth distribution raises the average yearly return from 3.6\% to 8.3\%. To understand how these return differences shape the distribution of wealth, I introduce realistic return heterogeneity in a partial equilibrium model of household saving behavior. This exercise suggests that considering both earnings and return heterogeneity can fully account for the top 10\% wealth share observed in the data (76\%), which cannot be explained by earnings differences alone},

It requires the assumption that the average outcomes of treated and control units would have followed parallel paths in the absence of treatment. In this paper, we propose a method that not only relaxes this often-violated assumption, but also unifies the synthetic control method (Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller 2010) with linear fixed effects models under a simple framework, of which DID is a special case. It imputes counterfactuals for each treated unit using control group information based on a linear interactive fixed effects model that incorporates unit-specific intercepts interacted with time-varying coefficients. This method has several advantages. First, it allows the treatment to be correlated with unobserved unit and time heterogeneities under reasonable modeling assumptions. Second, it generalizes the synthetic control method to the case of multiple treated units and variable treatment periods, and improves efficiency and interpretability. Third, with a built-in cross-validation procedure, it avoids specification searches and thus is easy to implement. An empirical example of Election Day Registration and voter turnout in the United States is provided.},

Starting from the sample mean labor share in our panel, this amounts to about 4.26percentage points. This relationship is robust to considering OECD and non-OECD samples separately. It is also (both qualitatively and quantitatively) robust to controlling for differences in human capital levels, labor productivity, trade union density, and international economic flows. Breaking the EFW into its individual component areas, the regulation of credit, business and labor appears to be the most important source of the positive EFW--labor share relationship.},

Changes in industry shares in total value-added are essentially unrelated to aggregate labor's share movements. Industry labor's shares comovements contribute positively to aggregate labor's share movements. These findings give us a clearer perspective on one of the stylized facts of economic growth. If the great macroeconomic ratio is meaningful, it must be interpreted in terms of long-run, offsetting shifts in ``services'' industries versus ``goods'' industries, both in terms of their labor's shares and shares in total value-added. At least at an annual frequency, there is nothing particularly stable about aggregate labor's share.},

  abstract = {We adopt the innovative synthetic control method (SCM) to study the causal effect of joining the European Monetary Union (EMU) on member countries' labor productivity. Comparing labor productivity between members and their synthetic counterparts, we find that Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, and the Netherlands experienced significant labor productivity gains from the eurozone membership. Our results are robust to a series of sensitivity checks. We also observe similar effects of EMU on members' total factor productivity (TFP). Furthermore, we explore potential channels through which a monetary union can influence members' labor productivity. Our results show that business cycle synchronization with other members and similar labor market institutions to other members contribute to an EMU country's labor productivity gains.},

  abstract = {This article shows that official statistics substantially underestimate the net foreign asset positions of rich countries because they fail to capture most of the assets held by households in offshore tax havens. Drawing on a unique Swiss data set and exploiting systematic anomalies in countries' portfolio investment positions, I find that around 8\% of the global financial wealth of households is held in tax havens, three-quarters of which goes unrecorded. On the basis of plausible assumptions, accounting for unrecorded assets turns the eurozone, officially the world's second largest net debtor, into a net creditor. It also reduces the U.S. net debt significantly. The results shed new light on global imbalances and challenge the widespread view that after a decade of poor-to-rich capital flows, external assets are now in poor countries and debts in rich countries. I provide concrete proposals to improve international statistics.}

  abstract = {Achieving low unemployment in an environment of weak growth is a major policy challenge; a more egalitarian distribution of hours worked could be the key to solving it. Whether work-sharing actually increases employment, however, has been debated controversially. In this article we present stylized facts on the distribution of hours worked and discuss the role of work-sharing for a sustainable economy. Building on recent developments in labor market theory we review the determinants of working long hours and its effect on well-being. Finally, we survey work-sharing reforms in the past. While there seems to be a consensus that work-sharing in the Great Depression in the U.S. and in the Great Recession in Europe was successful in reducing employment losses, perceptions of the work-sharing reforms implemented between the 1980s and early 2000s are more ambivalent. However, even the most critical evaluations of these reforms provide no credible evidence of negative employment effects; instead, the overall success of the policy seems to depend on the economic and institutional setting, as well as the specific details of its implementation.},
